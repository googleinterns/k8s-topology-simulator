# Kubernetes Topology Simulator

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

This will be a key part in the planning and design of topology aware routing for
Kubernetes. This specific project will include:

* Building a tool that can be used to test the effectiveness of different
  topology aware routing algorithms.
* Tweaking algorithms that have already been proposed or propose new ones.
* Writing a report that summarizes the different approaches that can be used for
  topology aware routing along with a recommendation.
